# Dereferencing a Null Pointer in C

This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming: dereferencing a null pointer.  The `bug.c` file contains code that attempts to access memory pointed to by a null pointer.  This leads to undefined behavior, typically a program crash. The `bugSolution.c` demonstrates how to avoid this error by performing null pointer checks before dereferencing.

This is a fundamental C programming concept. It is important to understand null pointers and how to handle them properly to prevent unexpected program crashes.
